The JavaScript Language
=========================

-> JavaScript is the only programming language available in web-browser and that is
   why every web-developer must have to learn this language.

-> JavaScript is also known as "Mocha" or "ES - ECMAScript". The term "JavaScript"
   has nothing to do with Java or Java technologies.

-> JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language and it is available 
   everywhere. We don't have to install JavaScript. It is already with Web-browsers
   as well as  JavaScript Server Environment, the NodeJS.

-> JavaScript is the specification based language. The European Computer Merchant 
   Association define the "standard or specification for JavaScript language" and 
   vendors like Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Apple and many more implement the    ECMAScript specification.

   At present, all web-browsers have ECMAScript 5 (ES5) standard of JavaSCript    environment and 70% of the web-browsers also have ES6 standard.

   Next standard of ECMA number will be given as per year number. For example, ECMA    2018 and so on.

What are the base software that constitute the web-browser Or Ingredient of web-browser.
-----------------------
 A web-browser is made up of following languages, tools and APIs:
  1. Html parser
  2. XML parser
  3. JavaScript language
  4. CSS Language
  5. Graphics Render Engine
  6. Developer Tool
  7. Plug-in or Add-on development kit
  8. Network APIs, I/O APIs
  9. SVG - Scalar Vector Graphics APIs and SVG Parser
 10. Canvas - Graphics API

 And also there are many more components, tools and APIs in web-browser. In fact, the web-browser (modern web-browsers) is just like an operating system. [FireFox OS, JIO mobile OS, Cromium OS etc) and the JavaScript is the only language for this OS.

In other words, all kind or type of APIs in web-browser are accessible via JavaScript program.

Why one should learn & use the JavaScript language?
---------------------------------------------------

1. It is the only programming language in browser.
2. It is used to read, update, replace, or add or remove HTML objects programatically.
3. It is used to request the resources/pages via program and also receive the response
   and this technique is know as AJAX - Asynchronious JavaScript And XML.
4. JavaScript is pure object-oriented progaming language and we will have to use its
   types system to model the data.
   Arrays, functions, closure, objects, classes, inheritance etc are the common
   content of this language.

5. It uses graphics engine's API to draw or paint the primitve graphics.
6. Provide the APIs to process the SVG objects.
