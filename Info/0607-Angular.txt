Angular JS
==========

A framework to develop client applications using HTML and TypeScript. 

Angular is MVC application design framework. The Angular core library is entirely written in "TypeScript" language.

Installation/setup of angular environment
==========================================

In order to use the Angular IO/JS, we need to install following components/tools in given order:

1. NodeJS
2. Git
3. TypeScript and
4. Angular/CLI - Command Line Interface tool

Angular/CLI tool is a helper tool for the developers that they don't have to write configuration code, or create directory structure and files -- programs, html,css, as per Angular's naming conventions. This tool automatically manages number of things for us including:

   1. Create a new project e.g   >ng new project-name
   2. Update an exiting project with dependencies e.g > ng update
   3. Start the development server e.g >ng start
   4. Unit test the components/code e.g >ng test
   5. Compile and bundle the project e.g >ng build
   6. To open the online help. e.g >ng doc <helpTopic>

How to create a new project?
-----------------------------
Use >ng command to manage the project.

>ng new project-name  

Note: Project name should be in lower letter without whitespaces. Use hyphen (don't use underscore) to separate the project name.
e.g
>ng new blog

This command will create a folder named "blog" and copy all necessary angular as well as node libraries in it.

\blog>dir    <-- will display the project structure
