Hash your passwords
-------------------

Never save plain text passwords in databases. Always use hash functions like sha(), md5(), crypt() etc. It is important to note that the sha() and md5() functions are consider weak as compare to crypt because md5 or sha hash can be tempered.

So, always use crypt() with "salt" (extra random string).

Example: Calculate the hash from "plain" text password

<?php 
  $plain = "admin";
  $salt = "123412";   # Anything -- any data
  $hash =  crypt($plain, $salt);
   
  echo "<br/>", $hash;

Example: Compare hashed password with user input password
 $user_pass = "admin";
 $hashed_password = ******  // Assume that we already have a hash password
 if (hash_equals($hashed_password, 
  	     crypt($user_pass, $hashed_password))) {
   echo "Password verified!";
  } else {
    echo "Not valid";
  }

You can define functions in your class: (code in Db.php class):
...
static function hash($plain) {
  return crypt($plain, "This is my salt !@#$#");
}
static function valid_pass($plain, $hashed) {
  return hash_equals($hashed, hash($plain));
}
