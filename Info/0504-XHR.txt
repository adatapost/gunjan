The XMLHttpRequest Object
=========================

To request the web-resources programatically and also send the data to the server programs.

This kind of communication is also known as AJAX - Asyncronious JavaScript And XML - where request and request data and response and response data being sent and received backgroundly or asynchroniously.

To request web-resources (files or programs at server location):
 1. assume that we've following files at /www/mywebapp  folder 

    1. my-data.json
[{"no": 10,"name": "Reena"},{"no":22, "name": "Meena"}]
    2. site.json
    { "name": "The Appleman Pvt Ltd", "owner: " ABC" }
    3. sample.php
       <?php echo "Welcome to PHP. To day is " . date("d-m-Y");
    4. sample.txt
        This is a text file.
    5. index.html <--- Add code to request different resources backgroundly.
                      
     So, code in index.html:
<script>
    //1. Create XHR object
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    //2. Set URL and Request method (GET or POST)
    xhr.open("post","my-data.json");

    //3. Set the callback - The XHR returns status code in the form of readyState 
    //   property and if readyState == 4 (xhr.DONE) then we've returned output/result
    //   in "xhr.responseText" proeprty

    xhr.onreadystatechange = ()=> {
    	console.log( xhr.DONE , xhr.readyState);
        if(xhr.DONE == xhr.readyState) {
             console.log( xhr.responseText );
             // let obj = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
             // console.dir( obj );
         }
     };

   //4. Tell the XHR to start the request
    xhr.send();
</script>
